INTRO - The Problem (0:00 - 0:45)
[SCREEN: Showing Mo Gawdat's LinkedIn/social media post]
YOU:
"I saw this post from Mo Gawdat the other day. If you don't know him, he's the former Chief Business Officer at Google X, and I really respect his insights on AI and consciousness.
[READ excerpt, emphasizing]:
'In 2007, an MIT study put people in MRI machines... The brain discovered the answer first, in silence. Then, a few seconds later, the verbal part lit up.'
This fascinated me. I immediately sent it to friends. Then I did what any curious person would do—I tried to find this MIT study.

And... I couldn't find it. Is it real? Is it misremembered? Was this post AI-generated? I have no idea.
And that's the problem. We're drowning in interesting claims, but we have no easy way to verify them."

SOLUTION (0:45 - 1:05)
[SCREEN: Close browser tabs, take a breath]
YOU:
"That's exactly why we built Fact-It. It's a Chrome extension that automatically fact-checks claims in social media posts—right where you're reading them.
Let me show you how it works."

DEMO - Part 1: Automatic Checking (1:05 - 1:50)
[SCREEN: Refresh the Mo Gawdat post with Fact-It installed]
YOU:
"So here's that same post. With Fact-It installed, watch what happens.
[SCREEN: Show the extension analyzing the post - loading state]
Fact-It automatically detects claims in the post and starts checking them in the background.
[SCREEN: Results appear next to the post]
And here we go. It's identified the key claim about the '2007 MIT study' and shows me:

The confidence level - in this case, it couldn't verify this specific claim
An explanation of what it found
And sources it checked

[SCREEN: Click to expand the details]
So now I know: be a little skeptical. This might be a real study that's hard to find, or it might be inaccurate. Either way, I'm informed."

DEMO - Part 2: Key Features (1:50 - 2:35)
[SCREEN: Open extension settings]
YOU:
"Now, here's what makes Fact-It powerful:
[SCREEN: Show model provider settings]
One: You can configure different AI model providers—OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini—and run them in parallel. This gives you multiple perspectives on the same claim.
[SCREEN: Navigate to another social media post, maybe Twitter/X or Facebook]
Two: It works across platforms—Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, wherever you see claims.
[SCREEN: Show the extension icon, toggle off automatic mode]
Three: Don't want it running on everything? Just disable automatic checks...
[SCREEN: Click the extension icon on a post to manually trigger]
...and trigger it manually only when you want to verify something. You stay in control."

CLOSING (2:35 - 3:00)
[SCREEN: Back to a clean view, maybe showing multiple verified posts]
YOU:
"Look, we're not trying to be the arbiters of truth. Fact-It is a tool to help you think critically about what you read online.
In a world where AI can generate incredibly convincing content, and misinformation spreads faster than ever, you deserve to know when something might not be what it seems.
